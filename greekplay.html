    <h2><span style="color:green";>Philoctetes by Sophocles</span></h2>

    <h3>Neoptolemus</h3>
    <p>I will speak, and thou shalt mark me. All this time
        I have been tortured with remorse, because,
        Beguiled by those I should not have obeyed,
        I have deceived thee and brought all this wrong
        On thee, thou injured one! Forgive me, son
        Of Poeas!—let me hear thee say, “I forgive thee.”</p>

    <h3>Philoctetes</h3>
    <p><em>_Philoctetes frowns, confused._</em><br>
        Say what? Thou talk'st, methinks, beyond my ken.</p>

    <h3>Neoptolemus</h3>
    <p>I will repeat it. All my evil act
        Was wrought at the behest of these, not mine.</p>

    <h3>Philoctetes</h3>
    <p>_Philoctetes clenches his fists._<br>
        How? By whose urging couldst thou do such things?</p>

    <h3>Neoptolemus</h3>
    <p>The Atreidae and Odysseus pressed it on me.</p>

    <h3>Philoctetes</h3>
    <p><span style="color:red;">_Philoctetes raises his voice._</span><br></p>
    

    <h3>Neoptolemus</h3>
    <p>It is their cause that now compels my going.</p>
