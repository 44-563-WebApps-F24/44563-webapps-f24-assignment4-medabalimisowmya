    <p class="speech"> will speak, and thou shalt mark me. All this time
        I have been tortured with remorse, because,
        Beguiled by those I should not have obeyed,
        I have deceived thee and brought all this wrong
        On thee, thou injured one! Forgive me, son
        Of Poeas!—let me hear thee say, “I forgive thee.”</p>

        Was wrought at the behest of these, not mine.</p>
